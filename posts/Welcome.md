# Welcome

This post lives in `posts/welcome.md`. Point a blog entry's `contentPath` to this file (or replace it with your own) and the viewer will render it on-site with Markdown + DOMPurify.

- Works with markdown or raw HTML
- Lives alongside the static site, so it loads even without external requests
- Safe by default thanks to sanitization

Happy shipping.
